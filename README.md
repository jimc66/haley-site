## ⚙️ Setup & Editing

This site is **100% static HTML** with CDN-loaded Tailwind + DaisyUI. **No build step, no compilation, no npm dependencies.**

### Local Development

Use VS Code with the Live Server extension for local preview:

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Right-click any `.html` file and select "Open with Live Server"
3. The site will open in your browser with auto-reload on changes

**Alternative:** You can use any simple web server (e.g., `python -m http.server`)

**Note:** You need a local server (not just opening files directly) due to CORS restrictions on the navbar fetch.
